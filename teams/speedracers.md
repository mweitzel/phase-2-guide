### Keyboard Events - Dave
* There are several keyboard events, keydown, keypress, keyup
* keydown/keypress are doubled
* keypress is for getting which characters were pressed
* keydown/keyup is for which *key* was pressed
* keydown/keyup return different keycodes/charcodes than keypress
* [input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/input)
  seems better for getting spans of text, such as from forms
